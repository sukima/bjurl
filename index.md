title: "The better jQuery URL grabber"
--- 
This is an [irssi][1] script that grabs the URLs printed in any window and logs it to a web site.

It has the option to execute a browser, Save a static HTML page, or produce a Web 2.0 ajax based site that updates every 30 seconds.

The website is useful for when you access irssi from a remote terminal and you do not have command line access to a browser.

## Acknowledgments

This script is a direct fork of the [Better URL (burl)][2] script by **Hugo Haas** and much of the same code is still there.

It is licensed under the _BSD License_

## Installation
