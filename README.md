This is an [irssi][1] script that grabs the URLs printed in any window and logs
it to a web site.

To see this in action see the [Demo](http://sukima.github.com/bjurl/).

## Acknowledgements

This script is a direct fork of the [Better URL (burl)][2] script by **Hugo
Haas** and much of the same code is still there.
